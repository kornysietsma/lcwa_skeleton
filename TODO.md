##TODO
- remove ajax wait cursor stuff - it's not 100% reliable it seems, and raphael is distracting to new users
- tweak the domain from the client (just to show how it's done) - easier now we have a db!
- add sinatra/reloader for dev mode
- add a "getting started" section for building from scratch (especially installing coffeescript!)
- (more) testing:
-- rspec server-side unit testing
-- javascript client-side unit testing
-- javascript client/server integration testing (try jasmine?)
-- selenium and cucumber for acceptance-style BDD testing
- set up client-side caching in browser store (need a library if we're not using sammy!)
- add rake tasks to compile coffee/scss manually, and to stop/start watch servers?
- actually implement offline application behaviour [http://diveintohtml5.org/offline.html]
- think about mobile version - might make sense to have a completely separate mobile sample
- better link management - be nice if you could right-click a "#" link and open in a new window!
-- but that means with 2 widgets, changing the state of one should change the # links for the other...
-- might be worth leaving the 'data-link' attribute there, using it to rebuild the href on state change.
